Now and again I see people talking about foundation models for time series data. It's one of those things, like the puzzlement over the inability of deep learning models to outperform traditional models tabular data, that makes me think people don't grasp the generality of of tabular and time series data. Time series and tabular data are much more general than images, images and text data. In my opinion, much of the success of current methods relies on exploiting the structure of the data. The generality of these data type imho precludes finding such structure except in specific, limited cases e.g. speech recognition, weather data etc.

The M competitions have been very important in ML fore timeseries. Refs:

## Approaches

### usual suspects

- xgboost https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XGBoost

A classical approach for time series modelling in machine learning is Gaussian Processes:

- The canonical reference is [gaussian process book](https://gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW.pdf)
- An interesting application to solar energy is [Grouped Gaussian processes for solar power prediction](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-019-05808-z)

#### frequency methods

- wavelets

#### other models - HMMs, ensembles, etc

An interesting and somewhat controversial topic is the "self-tuning" prophet models developed by Facebook researchers Sean Taylor and Benjamin Lentham.

## Reference material

### Books
Time series arise in so many application the literature about them is enormous, but  the resources here are practically focused.

- A very useful book for learning basic time series is by Robert Hyndman and co called ["Forecasting: Principles and Practice"](https://otexts.com/fpp3/advanced-reading.html)
- Any econometrics textbook will have a discussion of time series methods and/or it's cousin, panel data.
